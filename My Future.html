<h1>My Future</h1>
	<p> For my future, after high school I want to<Strong> proceed my education further throughout college</Strong>. In college I would hopefully want to get a degree in business or some other field that interests me. During college I want to possibly play soccer for some smaller college at first and hopefully get an offer for another bigger college. After college I would want to make it professionally in soccer. But if that doesn't work out, I would want to do something for business. </p>
