It’s an iconic image for the citizens of the United States of America: their flag, planted on the moon and waving gently in the breeze. Only, there is no breeze on the moon, meaning there is no air in the moon’s atmosphere, and hence, there is no wind whatsoever. This is one of the most obvious stuff ups in the staged moon landing hoax. Of course, NASA tries to get around this by saying it wasn’t blowing in the wind, it was just a bit crumpled from being rolled up on the journey…Well, judge for yourself.<p></td>

		<td style="color:#FFF;"><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Is There More Than One Sun? Because Those Shadows Don’t Match Up!</strong>-
NASA produced an abundant supply of photos and video footage to support their moon landing. But, it soon became evident that there was something a bit fishy about these photos on the moon; ever noticed that the angle of the shadows do not match up? Shadows are caused by light sources. On the moon, there should only be one light source: the Sun. So, logically, all shadows should be parallel to each other. Only shadows in the photos of moon landing are not. In fact, the shadows in many of the photos run in different directions. It’s almost as if the shadows are caused by… yes, multiple lights on a film set!</p></td>

		<td style="color:#FFF;"><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"><strong>What’s That I Can See Reflected in Your Helmet?</strong>
When the photos were published of the Apollo 12 moon landing, many people noticed something a tad unusual reflected in the shiny helmet of an astronaut. It appeared to be something hanging from a wire or perhaps a rope. In fact, it looked suspiciously like an overhead spotlight, the kind you see used in Hollywood movie studios. Whilst admittedly, the photo quality is a bit grainy, making it impossible to positively identify the object. It still begs the question: what could possibly be suspended in midair on the moon? There should be nothing there for anything to be hanging from!</p></td>
